## Description

#### When

I did these games during my **master in Japan**, at the Osaka Prefecture University in *2013**. I was near the end of my master and was looking for an internship. As I wanted to find something related to cognitive science or artificial intelligence, I decided to practice some algorithms I found in a book: “Programing Game AI by example” by Mat Buckland, 2005.

In addition, I read a while back a book on game programing: “Game Programming All in one” by Jonathan, S. Harbour, 2004. I learned the C++ library Allegro for game programing and I decided to use it in my project.

#### What

I implemented 3 different algorithms: a **finite state machine**, a **path finding** and a **steering behaviors**.  These algorithms were basics and really important in AI, and quite interesting and challenging to implement.

* In the book in read, a first introduction to basic AI behavior was given with a **finite state machine**. As it was a really useful and important algorithm to now, I decided to implement it.
* It was quite the same way I decided to implement the **path finding** algorithm. A* is such an overused technique I had to learn and try it. 
* Another really interesting algorithm was **steering behaviors**. It was quite intriguing in the book and I was interested in this for another project of mine, so I decided to implement it. 

#### How

As mentioned, this project was developed in **C++** using the **Allegro** library. I developed it using **Code::Blocks** IDE. The library contain all that is needed for 2D game programing, with drawing functions, sound, gamepad, and more.

#### Note

I carefully commented the code on these projects and tried to make them modular. It’s a good example of my coding style.
